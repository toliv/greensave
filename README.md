# Greensave

This repo contains two folders

- `scripts`: some Python scripts to scrape data from Home Depot's API + fetch data from EnergyStar's API
- `web/green_save` a NextJS app which (at this point in time) guides a user through a questionnaire flow.

Please read `web/green_save/README.md` for instructions on running the NextJS app.
